    \napart all of our sheets when he was bored 
    \nexcept for this blanket over here. Rex decided
    \nto spare this ugly white blanket that my 
    \ngrandmother gave me from her war days. We
    \nnever threw it away because we felt bad. 
    \nSeeing Rex sleep on this blanket made us 
    \nhappy. At least someone was using this 
    \nblanket, even if we had to rebuy brand new
    \nsheets because we have such an amazing dog.
    \n\n\nWe love you Rex.
